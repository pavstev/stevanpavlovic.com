Algorithms are step-by-step procedures for solving problems and processing data. This category covers fundamental algorithms, data structures, and computational thinking approaches used in software development.

## Categories

- **Sorting Algorithms**: QuickSort, MergeSort, BubbleSort, HeapSort
- **Search Algorithms**: Binary Search, DFS, BFS, A\* Search
- **Graph Algorithms**: Shortest path, topological sort, cycle detection
- **Dynamic Programming**: Memoization, tabulation, optimization techniques
- **Data Structures**: Trees, graphs, hash tables, heaps, tries

## Use Cases

- Efficient data processing and manipulation
- Search optimization and retrieval
- Pathfinding and routing
- Data compression and encoding
- Machine learning algorithm implementation

## Best Practices

- Choose appropriate algorithmic complexity (O(n), O(log n))
- Optimize for specific constraints (time, space)
- Use proven algorithmic patterns
- Implement proper error handling and edge cases
- Profile and benchmark performance

## Common Patterns

- Divide and conquer for complex problems
- Greedy algorithms for optimization
- Backtracking for search problems
- Sliding window for subarray problems
- Two-pointer techniques for array manipulation
