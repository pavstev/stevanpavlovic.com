Application Programming Interfaces, REST, GraphQL, and connectivity standards. This category explores the fundamental tools, patterns, and architectural decisions relevant to API.

## Technologies

- **Core Tools**: Essential libraries and frameworks for API.
- **Platforms**: Leading services and infrastructure providers.
- **Standards**: Industry-standard protocols and specifications.
- **Monitoring**: Tools for observability and metrics in API systems.
- **Development**: SDKs and utilities for building API solutions.

## Use Cases

- Enterprise system integration
- High-scale data processing
- Real-time user interaction handling
- Automated resource management
- Cross-platform compatibility assurance

## Best Practices

- Prioritize security and compliance at every layer
- Implement robust error handling and recovery mechanisms
- Optimize for low latency and high throughput
- Maintain comprehensive documentation and API contracts
- Design for scalability and future extensibility

## Common Patterns

- **Microservices**: Decoupling components for better manageability
- **Event-Sourcing**: Capturing state changes as a sequence of events
- **Caching**: Improving response times for frequently accessed data
- **Load Balancing**: Distributing traffic across multiple resources
- **Circuit Breaker**: Preventing cascading failures in distributed systems
