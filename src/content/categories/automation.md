Automation involves using tools and scripts to perform repetitive tasks without manual intervention. This category covers CI/CD pipelines, build automation, deployment automation, and workflow optimization.

## Technologies

- **CI/CD Tools**: Jenkins, GitLab CI, GitHub Actions, CircleCI
- **Build Tools**: Make, Gradle, Maven, Webpack
- **Configuration Management**: Ansible, Chef, Puppet
- **Scripting**: Bash, Python, PowerShell
- **Container Orchestration**: Kubernetes, Docker Swarm

## Use Cases

- Automated testing and quality gates
- Continuous integration and deployment pipelines
- Infrastructure as code and provisioning
- Automated backups and disaster recovery
- Monitoring and alerting automation

## Best Practices

- Automate repetitive and error-prone tasks
- Use version control for automation scripts
- Implement proper error handling and logging
- Design for idempotency and reusability
- Monitor and measure automation effectiveness

## Common Patterns

- Pipeline as code for reproducibility
- GitOps for infrastructure management
- Blue-green deployments for zero-downtime releases
- Canary deployments for gradual rollouts
- Feature flags for controlled feature rollout
