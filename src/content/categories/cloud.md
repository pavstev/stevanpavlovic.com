Cloud computing provides on-demand computing resources over the internet. This includes infrastructure as a service (IaaS), platform as a service (PaaS), and software as a service (SaaS) solutions for building and deploying applications at scale.

## Technologies

- **Providers**: AWS, Google Cloud, Azure, DigitalOcean
- **Services**: Compute (EC2, Lambda), Storage (S3, EBS), Database (RDS, DynamoDB)
- **Networking**: VPC, Load Balancers, CDN
- **DevOps**: CI/CD, Infrastructure as Code, Monitoring

## Use Cases

- Scalable web application hosting
- Serverless computing and microservices
- Data storage and content delivery
- Machine learning and AI services
- Enterprise application migration

## Best Practices

- Implement proper security groups and IAM roles
- Use infrastructure as code (Terraform, CloudFormation)
- Monitor costs and optimize resource usage
- Implement backup and disaster recovery
- Follow cloud provider best practices and compliance

## Common Patterns

- Multi-cloud and hybrid cloud strategies
- Serverless architecture for event-driven applications
- Container orchestration with Kubernetes
- Microservices deployment and scaling
- Global content delivery and edge computing
