Database technologies encompass data storage, retrieval, and management systems. This includes relational databases, NoSQL databases, caching systems, and data warehousing solutions for handling structured and unstructured data.

## Technologies

- **Relational**: PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQL Server, Oracle
- **NoSQL**: MongoDB, Cassandra, DynamoDB
- **Caching**: Redis, Memcached
- **Time-series**: TimescaleDB, InfluxDB
- **Search**: Elasticsearch, Solr

## Use Cases

- Storing application data with ACID properties
- Caching frequently accessed data
- Real-time analytics and monitoring
- Full-text search and indexing
- Data warehousing and business intelligence

## Best Practices

- Design proper database schemas and indexes
- Implement backup and disaster recovery
- Monitor performance and query optimization
- Ensure data security and compliance
- Use appropriate database for specific use cases

## Common Patterns

- Database normalization and denormalization
- Connection pooling for performance
- Read replicas for scaling reads
- Sharding for horizontal scaling
- Eventual consistency for distributed systems
