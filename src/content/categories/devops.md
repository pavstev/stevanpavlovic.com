DevOps combines software development and IT operations to shorten the development lifecycle and provide continuous delivery. This includes automation, monitoring, and collaboration practices for building, testing, and deploying software.

## Technologies

- **CI/CD**: Jenkins, GitHub Actions, GitLab CI
- **Containerization**: Docker, Podman
- **Orchestration**: Kubernetes, Docker Swarm
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus, Grafana, ELK Stack
- **Infrastructure**: Terraform, Ansible, Pulumi

## Use Cases

- Automated testing and deployment pipelines
- Infrastructure provisioning and management
- Application monitoring and alerting
- Configuration management and secrets
- Performance optimization and capacity planning

## Best Practices

- Implement infrastructure as code
- Use version control for all configurations
- Automate testing and deployment processes
- Monitor application and infrastructure metrics
- Practice continuous improvement and feedback

## Common Patterns

- GitOps for declarative infrastructure
- Blue-green deployments for zero downtime
- Canary releases for gradual rollouts
- Chaos engineering for resilience testing
- Site reliability engineering (SRE) practices
