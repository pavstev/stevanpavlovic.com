Security encompasses practices and technologies for protecting applications, data, and infrastructure from threats. This includes authentication, authorization, encryption, and compliance with security standards and regulations.

## Technologies

- **Authentication**: OAuth2, OpenID Connect, JWT, SAML
- **Authorization**: RBAC, ABAC, Attribute-based access control
- **Encryption**: TLS/SSL, AES, RSA, Hash functions
- **Compliance**: PCI DSS, SOC 2, HIPAA, GDPR
- **Security Tools**: WAF, IDS/IPS, SIEM, Vulnerability scanners

## Use Cases

- User authentication and authorization
- Data encryption at rest and in transit
- Secure API development and protection
- Compliance with regulatory requirements
- Security monitoring and incident response

## Best Practices

- Implement defense in depth strategy
- Follow principle of least privilege
- Use secure coding practices (OWASP Top 10)
- Regular security testing and penetration testing
- Implement proper logging and monitoring

## Common Patterns

- Zero trust security model
- Multi-factor authentication
- Role-based access control
- Secure by design principles
- Security as code practices
