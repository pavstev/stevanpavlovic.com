Testing encompasses methodologies and tools for ensuring software quality and reliability. This includes unit testing, integration testing, end-to-end testing, performance testing, and security testing throughout the software development lifecycle.

## Technologies

- **Unit Testing**: Jest, Mocha, JUnit, pytest
- **Integration Testing**: Supertest, Cypress, Selenium
- **E2E Testing**: Playwright, TestCafe, Puppeteer
- **Performance Testing**: k6, JMeter, Gatling
- **Security Testing**: OWASP ZAP, Burp Suite, Snyk

## Use Cases

- Automated testing in CI/CD pipelines
- Performance and load testing
- Security vulnerability scanning
- User acceptance testing
- Regression testing for new features

## Best Practices

- Write testable code with proper separation of concerns
- Implement test automation for regression testing
- Use test-driven development (TDD) where appropriate
- Maintain high code coverage with meaningful tests
- Include security testing in development process

## Common Patterns

- Arrange-Act-Assert (AAA) pattern
- Given-When-Then (GWT) for BDD
- Page Object Model for UI testing
- Mock and stub for external dependencies
- Contract testing for API integration
