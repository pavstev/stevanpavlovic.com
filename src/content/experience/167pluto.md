As a Senior Software Engineer at 167Pluto, I was instrumental in designing the core architecture of a high-load betting ecosystem. My role involved:

- **Distributed Systems Design**: Architecting a suite of 15+ microservices optimized for high availability and horizontal scalability.
- **Event-Driven Architecture**: implementing Kafka-based event sourcing to maintain data consistency across distributed ledgers while handling 100k+ events per second.
- **Performance Optimization**: Reducing API response times by 60% through aggressive caching strategies, database query tuning, and optimized Node.js event-loop management.
- **Infrastructure & DevOps**: Automating zero-downtime deployments on AWS using Kubernetes, ensuring seamless scaling during peak betting events like the World Cup.
- **Technical Mentorship**: Leading a team of 4 engineers, enforcing rigorous code quality standards, and implementing TDD practices.
