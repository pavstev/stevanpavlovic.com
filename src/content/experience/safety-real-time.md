As CTO, I led the technical transformation of the company from a startup to an enterprise-ready logistics platform provider.

- **Strategic Leadership**: Built and scaled the engineering team, defining the technology roadmap and aligning it with business goals.
- **Real-Time Data Processing**: Designed a WebSocket-based streaming architecture to push real-time telemetry to 10k+ concurrent users with minimal overhead.
- **Geospatial Engineering**: Optimized map rendering for thousands of moving markers, implementing clustering and viewport-based data fetching to maintain 60FPS performance.
- **Reliability Engineering**: Implemented TimescaleDB for efficient storage and querying of billions of time-series data points, enabling historical route playback and predictive maintenance analytics.
- **Security & Compliance**: Ensured strict adherence to data privacy regulations and implemented comprehensive audit trails for sensitive logistics data.
