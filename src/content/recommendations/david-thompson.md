Working with Stevan on the Intelligent Admissions module was one of the highlights of my product management career. This was an incredibly complex feature – we needed to automate college admission evaluation across hundreds of institutions, each with unique criteria, while maintaining transparency and trust from admission officers.

Stevan didn't just implement what was spec'd; he actively participated in product design, asking probing questions that improved the final solution. His suggestion to build a visual rule configuration system instead of code-based rules was brilliant – it made the system accessible to non-technical administrators and became a major selling point for Element451.

The technical execution was flawless. Stevan's scoring algorithm processed 200+ applicant properties in sub-second time, and the system handled 50K+ applications annually without issues. But what really impressed me was his focus on user experience – he built comprehensive audit trails showing exactly why the system recommended each action, which was crucial for gaining trust from skeptical admission officers.

Stevan's communication skills were exceptional for an engineer. He could explain complex technical concepts to non-technical stakeholders and translated business requirements into elegant technical solutions. He was always available for questions and proactively raised concerns when he saw potential issues.

I would enthusiastically work with Stevan again and recommend him for roles requiring both technical depth and product thinking. He's a complete engineer who understands that great software requires both technical excellence and solving real user problems.
