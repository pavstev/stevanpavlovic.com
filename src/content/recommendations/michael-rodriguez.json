  "text": "I had the pleasure of working with Stevan for over a year on our AskGamblers\nplatform, and his impact was transformative. When Stevan joined our team, we had\nseveral performance bottlenecks that had been plaguing us for months despite\nmultiple attempts to resolve them. Within his first two weeks, Stevan not only\nidentified the root causes but implemented solutions that reduced our server\nresource usage by 90% – a result that seemed impossible before he arrived.\n\nWhat impressed me most was his systematic approach to problem-solving. Stevan\ndidn't just fix immediate issues; he refactored entire subsystems to prevent\nsimilar problems in the future. His initiatives around clean architecture and\ncode quality elevated our entire team's standards. Multiple developers told me\nthat working with Stevan significantly improved their understanding of\narchitectural patterns and performance optimization.\n\nBeyond his technical excellence, Stevan was an exceptional team player. He\nmentored junior developers, conducted thorough code reviews, and always made\ntime to explain complex concepts. His communication skills made him valuable not\njust to engineering but across the organization – product managers and\nstakeholders consistently praised his ability to explain technical trade-offs in\nbusiness terms.\n\nI would work with Stevan again without hesitation and recommend him highly for\nsenior engineering roles or technical leadership positions. He's the kind of\nengineer who makes everyone around him better.",
