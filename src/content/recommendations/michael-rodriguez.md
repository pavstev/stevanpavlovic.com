I had the pleasure of working with Stevan for over a year on our AskGamblers platform, and his impact was transformative. When Stevan joined our team, we had several performance bottlenecks that had been plaguing us for months despite multiple attempts to resolve them. Within his first two weeks, Stevan not only identified the root causes but implemented solutions that reduced our server resource usage by 90% – a result that seemed impossible before he arrived.

What impressed me most was his systematic approach to problem-solving. Stevan didn't just fix immediate issues; he refactored entire subsystems to prevent similar problems in the future. His initiatives around clean architecture and code quality elevated our entire team's standards. Multiple developers told me that working with Stevan significantly improved their understanding of architectural patterns and performance optimization.

Beyond his technical excellence, Stevan was an exceptional team player. He mentored junior developers, conducted thorough code reviews, and always made time to explain complex concepts. His communication skills made him valuable not just to engineering but across the organization – product managers and stakeholders consistently praised his ability to explain technical trade-offs in business terms.

I would work with Stevan again without hesitation and recommend him highly for senior engineering roles or technical leadership positions. He's the kind of engineer who makes everyone around him better.
