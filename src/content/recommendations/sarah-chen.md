Stevan joined 167Pluto as a Senior Software Engineer, but his contributions went far beyond that title. He single-handedly architected our event-driven betting platform from the ground up, making critical decisions about microservices boundaries, data consistency patterns, and infrastructure that positioned us for scale.

The technical challenges we faced were significant – building a betting platform that could handle millions of concurrent users during major sporting events while maintaining data consistency and sub-100ms latency. Stevan's architecture using NestJS microservices and Kafka event streaming proved to be exactly what we needed. During our largest traffic event (World Cup final), the platform handled 2M+ concurrent users without a single hiccup.

What sets Stevan apart is his balance of pragmatism and technical excellence. He advocated for best practices like comprehensive testing and CI/CD automation, but he also knew when to ship and iterate rather than over-engineering. His CI/CD pipeline reduced our deployment time by 80% and enabled us to ship multiple times daily with confidence.

Stevan also emerged as a natural technical leader. He mentored three mid-level engineers who all significantly improved under his guidance. His code reviews were thorough yet constructive, and he established patterns and standards that the entire team adopted.

I cannot recommend Stevan highly enough. He's a rare combination of architectural vision, hands-on execution, and leadership ability. Any company would be fortunate to have him.
