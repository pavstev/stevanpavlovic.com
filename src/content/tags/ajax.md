description: AJAX - Asynchronous JavaScript and XML for dynamic web applications
---

AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML) enables web applications to send and retrieve data from a server asynchronously without interfering with the display and behavior of the existing page. This allows for dynamic, responsive user interfaces without full page reloads.

## Related Concepts

- **Asynchronous Programming**: Non-blocking operations and callbacks
- **REST APIs**: Communication with backend services
- **Single Page Applications**: Dynamic web applications
- **Fetch API**: Modern replacement for XMLHttpRequest
- **WebSockets**: Real-time bidirectional communication

## Use Cases

- Dynamic content loading without page refresh
- Form submissions with instant feedback
- Real-time data updates and notifications
- Infinite scrolling and lazy loading
- Interactive user interfaces with smooth transitions

## Technologies

- **XMLHttpRequest**: Original AJAX implementation
- **Fetch API**: Modern promise-based HTTP client
- **jQuery.ajax()**: Simplified AJAX calls
- **Axios**: Promise-based HTTP client
- **GraphQL**: Query language for APIs

## Best Practices

- Handle errors gracefully and provide user feedback
- Implement proper loading states and progress indicators
- Use appropriate HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
- Implement caching strategies for performance
- Secure AJAX requests with proper authentication

## Common Pitfalls

- Not handling network errors and timeouts
- Blocking UI during long operations
- Not implementing proper loading states
- Security vulnerabilities (CSRF, XSS)
- Performance issues with too many simultaneous requests
