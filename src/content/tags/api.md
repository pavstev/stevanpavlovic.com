description: API - Application Programming Interfaces for software communication
---

APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) are sets of rules and protocols that allow different software applications to communicate with each other. They define how requests and responses should be structured and handled.

## Related Concepts

- **REST**: Representational State Transfer architectural style
- **GraphQL**: Query language for APIs
- **WebSockets**: Real-time bidirectional communication
- **Microservices**: Distributed system architecture
- **SDKs**: Software Development Kits for API integration

## Use Cases

- Building web services and microservices
- Third-party integrations and partnerships
- Mobile app backend communication
- Data sharing between applications
- Automation and scripting

## Technologies

- **REST APIs**: HTTP-based APIs with standard methods
- **GraphQL APIs**: Flexible query language for APIs
- **gRPC**: High-performance RPC framework
- **WebSocket APIs**: Real-time bidirectional communication
- **SOAP APIs**: XML-based messaging protocol

## Best Practices

- Follow RESTful principles and HTTP standards
- Implement proper authentication and authorization
- Use versioning for API evolution
- Provide comprehensive documentation
- Implement proper error handling and status codes

## Common Pitfalls

- Poor API design leading to confusion
- Not handling errors properly
- Security vulnerabilities (injection, authentication)
- Performance issues with large payloads
- Breaking changes without versioning
