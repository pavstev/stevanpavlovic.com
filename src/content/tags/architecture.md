description: Architecture - Software architecture patterns and design principles
---

Software architecture encompasses the high-level structure and design patterns that guide software development. This includes architectural styles, design patterns, and principles for building scalable, maintainable, and robust systems.

## Related Concepts

- **Design Patterns**: Reusable solutions to common problems
- **Architectural Styles**: Microservices, monolithic, serverless, event-driven
- **System Design**: Scalability, performance, reliability considerations
- **Domain-Driven Design**: Modeling complex business domains
- **Infrastructure as Code**: Automated infrastructure management

## Use Cases

- Designing scalable system architectures
- Choosing appropriate technology stacks
- Planning system evolution and growth
- Ensuring system reliability and performance
- Facilitating team collaboration and communication

## Technologies

- **Architectural Styles**: Microservices, Monolithic, Serverless, Event-driven
- **Design Patterns**: Singleton, Factory, Observer, Strategy, Repository
- **Principles**: SOLID, DRY, KISS, YAGNI
- **Documentation**: UML, C4, Architecture Decision Records

## Best Practices

- Follow established design principles and patterns
- Document architectural decisions and trade-offs
- Design for scalability, performance, and maintainability
- Consider security and compliance requirements
- Plan for monitoring and observability

## Common Patterns

- Layered architecture for separation of concerns
- Event-driven architecture for loose coupling
- Microservices for independent deployment
- Domain-driven design for complex business logic
- API gateway for service composition
