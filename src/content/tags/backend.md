description: Backend - Server-side development and infrastructure
---

Backend development encompasses server-side technologies, APIs, databases, and infrastructure that power web applications. This includes programming languages, frameworks, databases, and architectural patterns used to build the server-side logic of applications.

## Related Concepts

- **Frontend**: Client-side development and user interfaces
- **Full-stack**: Both frontend and backend development
- **DevOps**: Development and operations practices
- **Database**: Data storage and management
- **API**: Application Programming Interfaces

## Use Cases

- Building RESTful APIs and web services
- Database design and optimization
- Authentication and authorization systems
- Real-time data processing and streaming
- Background job processing and task queues

## Technologies

- **Programming Languages**: Node.js, Python, Go, PHP, Java, C#
- **Frameworks**: Express, NestJS, Django, Laravel, Spring Boot
- **Databases**: PostgreSQL, MongoDB, MySQL, Redis
- **Architecture**: Microservices, REST APIs, GraphQL, Event-driven systems

## Best Practices

- Implement proper error handling and logging
- Use dependency injection for better testability
- Design for scalability and performance
- Follow security best practices (OWASP)
- Implement proper caching strategies

## Common Patterns

- Repository pattern for data access
- Service layer for business logic
- Middleware for cross-cutting concerns
- Event-driven architecture for loose coupling
- Circuit breakers for fault tolerance
