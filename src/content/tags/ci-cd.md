description: CI/CD - Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment
---

CI/CD (Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment) is a methodology that enables development teams to deliver code changes more frequently and reliably. CI focuses on integrating code changes regularly, while CD automates the deployment process.

## Related Concepts

- **DevOps**: Development and operations practices
- **Automation**: Automating repetitive tasks and workflows
- **Infrastructure as Code**: Automated infrastructure management
- **Testing**: Automated software testing
- **Version Control**: Managing code changes

## Use Cases

- Automated testing and deployment pipelines
- Infrastructure provisioning and management
- Application monitoring and alerting
- Configuration management and secrets
- Performance optimization and capacity planning

## Technologies

- **CI/CD**: Jenkins, GitHub Actions, GitLab CI
- **Containerization**: Docker, Podman
- **Orchestration**: Kubernetes, Docker Swarm
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus, Grafana, ELK Stack
- **Infrastructure**: Terraform, Ansible, Pulumi

## Best Practices

- Implement infrastructure as code
- Use version control for all configurations
- Automate testing and deployment processes
- Monitor application and infrastructure metrics
- Practice continuous improvement and feedback

## Common Pitfalls

- Over-automation leading to complexity
- Not monitoring automated processes
- Security vulnerabilities in automation scripts
- Performance issues with automated workflows
- Lack of proper error handling and recovery
