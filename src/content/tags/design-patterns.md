description: Design Patterns - Reusable solutions to common software problems
---

Design patterns are reusable solutions to common problems that occur in software design. They provide tested, proven development paradigms that speed up the development process and improve code quality.

## Related Concepts

- **Software Architecture**: High-level system structure
- **Object-Oriented Design**: Principles of OOP
- **Code Quality**: Writing clean, maintainable code
- **System Design**: Planning and structuring systems
- **Best Practices**: Industry-standard approaches

## Use Cases

- Creating maintainable and scalable software
- Solving common design problems efficiently
- Improving code readability and maintainability
- Facilitating team collaboration
- Reducing development time and costs

## Categories of Patterns

- **Creational**: Singleton, Factory, Builder, Prototype
- **Structural**: Adapter, Decorator, Facade, Proxy
- **Behavioral**: Observer, Strategy, Command, State
- **Architectural**: MVC, MVP, MVVM, Repository
- **Concurrency**: Producer-Consumer, Reader-Writer, Monitor

## Best Practices

- Use patterns appropriately, not excessively
- Understand the problem before applying patterns
- Consider trade-offs and limitations
- Document pattern usage and rationale
- Follow SOLID principles alongside patterns

## Common Pitfalls

- Over-engineering simple problems
- Using patterns without understanding them
- Creating unnecessary complexity
- Not considering performance implications
- Ignoring specific project requirements
