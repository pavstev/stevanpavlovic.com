description: DevOps - Development and operations practices for software delivery
---

DevOps combines software development and IT operations to shorten the development lifecycle and provide continuous delivery. This includes automation, monitoring, and collaboration practices for building, testing, and deploying software.

## Related Concepts

- **CI/CD**: Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment
- **Automation**: Automating repetitive tasks and workflows
- **Infrastructure as Code**: Automated infrastructure management
- **Monitoring**: Application and infrastructure monitoring
- **Collaboration**: Development and operations teamwork

## Use Cases

- Automated testing and deployment pipelines
- Infrastructure provisioning and management
- Application monitoring and alerting
- Configuration management and secrets
- Performance optimization and capacity planning

## Technologies

- **CI/CD**: Jenkins, GitHub Actions, GitLab CI
- **Containerization**: Docker, Podman
- **Orchestration**: Kubernetes, Docker Swarm
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus, Grafana, ELK Stack
- **Infrastructure**: Terraform, Ansible, Pulumi

## Best Practices

- Implement infrastructure as code
- Use version control for all configurations
- Automate testing and deployment processes
- Monitor application and infrastructure metrics
- Practice continuous improvement and feedback

## Common Pitfalls

- Over-automation leading to complexity
- Not monitoring automated processes
- Security vulnerabilities in automation scripts
- Performance issues with automated workflows
- Lack of proper error handling and recovery
