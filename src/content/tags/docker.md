description: Docker - Container platform for application deployment
---

Docker is a platform for developing, shipping, and running applications in containers. Containers allow developers to package applications with all their dependencies, ensuring consistent behavior across different environments.

## Related Concepts

- **Containerization**: Packaging applications with dependencies
- **Microservices**: Distributed system architecture
- **Orchestration**: Managing containerized applications
- **DevOps**: Development and operations practices
- **Cloud Native**: Building applications for cloud environments

## Use Cases

- Application packaging and deployment
- Development environment consistency
- Microservices architecture
- Continuous integration and deployment
- Scaling applications horizontally

## Technologies

- **Docker Engine**: Core container runtime
- **Docker Compose**: Multi-container applications
- **Docker Swarm**: Container orchestration
- **Kubernetes**: Advanced container orchestration
- **Container Registries**: Docker Hub, AWS ECR, Google Container Registry

## Best Practices

- Use multi-stage builds for smaller images
- Implement proper security measures
- Use .dockerignore files
- Follow container best practices
- Monitor container performance and health

## Common Pitfalls

- Large container images leading to slow deployments
- Security vulnerabilities in base images
- Not following container best practices
- Performance issues with improper configuration
- Lack of proper monitoring and logging
