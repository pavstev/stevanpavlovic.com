description: Elasticsearch - Distributed search and analytics engine
---

Elasticsearch is a distributed, RESTful search and analytics engine capable of solving a growing number of use cases. It provides near real-time search and analytics for all types of data.

## Related Concepts

- **Search Engines**: Full-text search and indexing
- **Analytics**: Data analysis and visualization
- **Distributed Systems**: Scalable and fault-tolerant systems
- **NoSQL Databases**: Non-relational data storage
- **Log Analysis**: Processing and analyzing log data

## Use Cases

- Full-text search and autocomplete
- Log analysis and monitoring
- Business analytics and reporting
- Application search functionality
- Security analytics and threat detection

## Features

- **Distributed**: Scales horizontally across multiple nodes
- **Real-time**: Near real-time search and analytics
- **RESTful**: JSON-based API for easy integration
- **Schema-free**: Flexible data modeling
- **Powerful Querying**: Complex search queries and aggregations

## Technologies

- **Elasticsearch**: Core search and analytics engine
- **Kibana**: Data visualization and exploration
- **Logstash**: Data processing pipeline
- **Beats**: Lightweight data shippers
- **X-Pack**: Security, monitoring, and alerting

## Best Practices

- Design proper index mappings and mappings
- Implement appropriate sharding and replication
- Monitor cluster health and performance
- Use appropriate query techniques
- Ensure data security and access control

## Common Pitfalls

- Poor index design leading to performance issues
- Not monitoring cluster health and performance
- Security vulnerabilities in data access
- Complex queries causing performance problems
- Not planning for scalability and growth
